## Coding along [Net Ninja](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9hNTz3sxqGTfxAwU-DIHJd2&si=FPLOq2OlJ5Nz1Smt)

## Essential concepts I learnt:
- What is React Native?
- Advantages of using/learning React Native
- Setting up and real-time viewing with Expo go
- Basic tags (View, Text, Image) and styling with css
- File based navigation / routing (Link tag)
- Using layout (Slot tag) to display header/footer in all pages
- Using Stack for smooth forward and backward navigation between pages
- Styling for dark and light mode using useColorScheme hook and simplifying it by creating themed components
- Grouping routes for better organization of related routes and layout for these grouped routes
- Using Pressable tag to create buttons, style based on states ('pressed') and handle presses
- Tabs navigation and styling tab (tab icons, background-color, etc...)
- Use of SafeAreaView tag and useSafeAreaInsets hook(a better alternative)
- Using TextInput tag to input text and using state variable to store it on change
- Setting up connection to Appwrite for authentication
- Logging users in and out, protecting routes and redirecting to different routes using useRouter hook
- Using ActivityIndicator tag to indicate loading
- Creating database, table with fields in Appwrite. Creating records with user input and fetching user related records
